pushing states for href links, rather than reloading page


cases
first time visit, load the components for this page
click and link or an event happens which changes the page and decides what to do with existing components

global components (navbar and/or side menus)
body component - parent to all other components, this should manage them too

rather than using Atlas.rerenderOnSet, instead create a listener function for all global components when a new page is pushed
e.g. onPush(){Quas.rerender(this);}

add Altas.push(pageID) so you can push to pages from events rather than just form a link click
